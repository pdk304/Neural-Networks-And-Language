# NeuralNetworksAndLanguage
My work in computational linguistics at Robert Frank's lab CLAY and his course in neural networks and language

## Project 1: Word Embeddings
Used word2vec and cosine similarity to examine how word embeddings encode meaning.

## Project 2: Language Model
Created a neural network language model from scratch using Numpy.

## Project 3: Part of Speech Tagger
Implemented both a fully connected and bi-directional RNN network models for English part of speech tagging

## Project 4: Seq2seq grammar machine translation
Implemented an encoder-decoder network for translating grammar phrases in English.
